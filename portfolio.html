    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h2>BobaBlitz</h2>
        <p class = "press-start 2p-regular">This is my game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the Phaser3 framework.

            Boba Blitz!

            ...a game for bubble tea addicts...

            To simulate making boba the user catches fresh ingredients, different types of 
            tea and tapioca pearls in their cup. Avoid ingredients that don't make sense 
            to make a refreshing cup of tea.

    <h2>Dialectable</h2>
        <p>This is my Design, Cultures, and Creativity Capstone Project made 
            with React Native with a Firebase backend and deployed using Expo.
            Dialectable is a language-learning cultural app that includes conversation-based 
            minigames, goal trackers, and a culture blog for immigrants to learn or relearn 
            their native language using ancestral knowledge. The app's main feature is the 
            ability to evaluate pronunciation in the minigames by recording a users's voice 
            for a specific word or sentence and crosschecking the voice against an AI model. 
            This allows the user to pick up the word's diction to mimic a native speaker and 
            become more comfortable using the verbiage. The user must gain consent to store 
            the speaker's voice, and the audio transcripts will be stored locally to maintain 
            privacy. I will use React Native and Expo to develop the app.</p>
    <h2>WhatsIt</h2>
        <p>The purpose of my website is to promote crochet materals that can be 
            used to make keychains and decor to encourage social interaction 
            amongst children in different environments. The website will also 
            include patterns that will be provided for free with instructions on 
            how to make the items and information on the importance of childrens'
             mental health. “WhatsIt” is short for “what's it called” and alludes 
             to the fact that the projects kids make can be used as a conversation starter.</p>
